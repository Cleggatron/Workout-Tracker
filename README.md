  ## Description

  The idea behind this project was to implement a simple MongoDB project in a real work application.

  Here we are making a simple workout tracker that can allow for flexible workout structure, as well as providing data on previous workouts so that users can track their progress and gains.

  ## Installation

  To run the application locally you will need to clone the repository. Once there you will need to run `npm i` to install dependencies. You will also need MONGODB installed locally to run this.

  If you wish to run this on a hosted website you will need to set up an online database storage (like Atlas by MongoDB). You will then need to set up your environment where you are hosting your website to allow for a connection to this.

  ## Usage

  Once the application is running (locally or deployed on the web), one can click the continue workout button, to add exercises to a current workout. Alternatively the New Workout button will allow the user to create a brand new workout from scratch. Finally the user can click the stats button to see the details of the past 7 workouts displayed graphically.
